      <h3 class="testimonial">Tammy Browne – Montego Bay Animal Haven</h3>
      <p>ISNN has definitely helped decrease the number of stray and unwanted dogs and cats on the streets of Jamaica. I first worked with them in October of 2009 where they were instrumental in the spaying and neutering of almost 300 animals over a 3-day period. This was offered as a free service for those who couldn&rsquo;t afford it.</p>
      <p>They have sent over a lot of books and general educational material which have been distributed to some schools in the area. ISNN wants to educate the general public and improve the health and welfare of the animals in and around the communities. A lot of animals and people have already been helped. This needs to continue!</p>
      <h3 class="testimonial">Cheryl Schweitzer, Trelawny, Jamaica</h3>
      <p>I took my two female cats and my female dog to Montego Bay, Jamaica when ISNN was there in October 2009. The surgeries were free of cost. I was able to take my pets home the same day. </p>
      <p>When I was there I saw a large group of volunteer vets and assistants expending a huge amount of energy to try to make a small dent in the animal population problems in Jamaica. They worked tirelessly for hours and hours without complaint in a non-air conditioned building, doing what they do best — helping animals.</p>
      <p>I am forever grateful to them for the time they so willingly gave to this project, which enabled me to get the surgeries for my animals that I would not have been able to do without their services.</p>

      <p>Few people or organizations have tried to do anything about the problem of dog and cat population control in Jamaica in a sustained manner. One of these is the International Spay/Neuter Network (ISNN) under the leadership of Ms. Kim Swaim. For years she has lobbied and worked to launch an on-going spay/neuter program on the island.</p>
      <p>Over the past two years, a significant start was made with the cooperation of the Jamaica Veterinary Medical Association. A number of spay/neuter clinics were held and public awareness has increased. Much more needs to be done.</p>
      <p>To achieve the goal of a sustained low or no cost program much support and long-term commitment is needed from those who have the resources to do so. Personally, I have taken note of the absolute dedication of Ms. Swaim and ISNN to the cause. I have seen the resources that have been acquired and sent to Jamaica utilized for their intended purpose, with proper records being kept and due diligence in reporting back to donors.</p>
      <p>I therefore unreservedly recommend that ISNN be given all possible support in the implantation of this program. It will be of untold benefit to our animals, our people, and our country.</p>
      <h3 class="testimonial">Cindi Scholefield</h3>
      <p>I met Ms. Swaim in December of 2008 when she was holding the first spay/neuter clinic in Jamaica, and I was so impressed by her dedication to helping dogs, and by her organizational skills, that I volunteered to help. So it was that a little stray, &lsquo;Bones&rsquo;, who I had picked up on the street, got neutered along with over 100 others in a 2-day clinic in two separate locations, involving a rapid spay expert veterinarian whom she brought with her, a number of local vets, vet techs, and volunteers. It was a mammoth undertaking and had been years in the planning to bring in all the drugs, instruments, people, materials and equipment necessary.</p>
      <p>Since that time Ms. Swaim has held several other spay/neuter clinics in other parts of the island, and the response is improving. However, Jamaica has two problems in this regard — one, a traditional mindset that believes reproduction, whether human or animal, should not be interfered with (hence the exploding human population); and two, a level of poverty which means that personal survival is most urgent, and caring for animals always comes last in the equation. Spaying and neutering dogs to control the population of strays and alleviate the suffering of those wandering the streets is something quite foreign to their thinking, and points to an urgent need for humane education, as well as continuing and regular spay/neuter clinics.</p>
      <p>In spite of the above, it is heartening to see more people from the grass-roots areas venturing in with their canine companions because they don&rsquo;t want to deal with anymore puppies, and little by little we are gaining ground. The road is long, and help of all kinds is needed to continue the work, but the rewards are great, knowing that after a successful clinic, you have saved hundreds, maybe thousands of dogs from lives of misery, hunger and pain.</p>

        <h2>Every Dollar Counts!</h2>
        <p>A donation of $25 pays for a female spay, preventing litter after litter of unwanted animals. If you consider that each unwanted animal born will go on to have many future litters of its own, you can see what a huge impact a single donation of $25 can make.</p>
