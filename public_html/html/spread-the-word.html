      <h1>Spread the Word</h1>
      <p>International Spay/Neuter Network (ISNN) believes word of mouth is one of the most effective ways to promote our efforts and gain interest in our cause. Here are some ways you can help us get our message out there.</p>
      <h3>Social Media</h3>
      <p>One of the easiest things you can do to let people know about ISNN is to &ldquo;Like&rdquo; us on Facebook. Just visit our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/InternationalSpayNeuterNetwork" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page and click the &ldquo;Like&rdquo; button — it&rsquo;s that simple! People often check out what their friends like, and they might &ldquo;Like&rdquo; us too. This is a quick way to get more people interested in our organization! If you want to take it a step further, post about ISNN on your blog, Facebook or Twitter page. </p>

      <h3>Contact Government Agencies</h3>
      <p>Let decision makers know what you think. A quick phone call, email or letter can have a big impact. Tell them you&rsquo;re concerned about the welfare of homeless animals in Jamaica, and you support ISNN’s humane approach to animal overpopulation. Visit our <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page to find contact information for various agencies.</p>
      <h3>Write an Article</h3>
      <p>Whether you live in Jamaica, have visited, or are simply a person who cares about animals, you can get the word out by writing an article to submit to magazines or newspapers. We have contact information for a number of publications on our <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.</p>
      <h3>Promote Cat Cafe Program</h3>
      <p>Have you stayed at a hotel in Jamaica and noticed a large number of stray cats on the property? Help us spread the word about our <a href="stray-cat-solutions.html">Cat Cafe Program</a> to hotel owners by calling, writing, or posting on their Facebook page. Your voice counts! Let them know you support our program as a human solution to cat overpopulation, and tell them you would enjoy your stay much more if cat colonies were healthy and well cared for.</p>

        <h2>My First Community Clinic</h2>
        <p>In November 2008 I was asked to give my spare room for a few days to a friend of a friend, who was coming to Jamaica to conduct a spay/neuter clinic for street dogs. Needless to say, I changed the sheets, plumped the pillows, welcomed my house guest and jumped head first into the project.</p>
